The Bayesian approach formally and statistically quantifies prior knowledge (\\(D_0\\)) about a hypothesis (\\(H\\)) in the form of a prior probability (\\(P_0\\)), which is then combined with the evidence from a new experiment (\\(D_N\\)) to compute a posterior probability (\\(P_1\\)) about the veracity of that hypothesis. The posterior probability can be recycled as input to form the prior for a subsequent experiment, thereby creating a virtuous cycle of synthesizing scientific knowledge about a hypothesis.\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-023-00638-0/figures/1"
